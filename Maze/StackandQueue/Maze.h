/* File: Maze.h
    This file contains the specification for a Maze class.
    The Maze is stored as a two-dimensional character array
    in which each character has the following meaning:
        # - wall
        o - starting position
        X - goal position
        . - open space
        * - visited
    The position of start is available with public
    member functions. Non-start positions can only be explored
    after a vertically or horizontally adjacent position has
    already been explored.
