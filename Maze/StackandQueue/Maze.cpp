/* Constructor
    Parameter: the filename containing the maze to be read in as
    a 2D array. The first line of a maze file contains the number
    of columns and rows respectively. All following lines gives the
    actual 2@ character array, with each line representing a row.
    Nothing is returned. There is console output only when the
    file fails to open.
    This is the only way to create a Maze - there are no other
    constructors, and no other member functions for setting up
    the maze array.
