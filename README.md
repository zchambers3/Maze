##Project: Maze 1 (Due at the end of Topic 1)
Write a program that reads in a description of a 2-dimensional maze with a Start and a Goal and then displays the maze. Use a two dimensional array of objects representing the squares. (This program will be extended and “refactored” several times during the class, so it is important to separate concerns into distinct single-purpose objects with minimal coupling.)

##Project: Maze 2 (Due at the end of Topic 2)
Replace the 2-dimensional array of objects in your Maze 1 program with linked lists of the same objects. The linked lists can be single, double, or circular as you deem appropriate for your implementation. Make as few changes as possible in the rest of the program. Write up what changes to Maze 1 would have reduced the number of such changes necessary. In retrospect, how would you have written Maze 1 differently?

##Project: Maze 3 (Due at the end of Topic 3)
Use a stack to find paths through the maze (from Start to Goal) utilizing your maze program. Illustrate the progress through the maze at each step. Your program should visually distinguish between the path identified and any backtracking that may have occurred. In addition, illustrate the content of the stack at each step.

##Project: Maze 4 (Due at the end of Topic 3)
Use a queue to find paths through the maze (from Start to Goal) utilizing your maze program. Illustrate the progress through the maze at each step. Your program should visually distinguish between the path identified and any backtracking that may have occurred. In addition, illustrate the content of the queue at each step.

##Project: Maze 5 (Due at the end of Topic 5)
Implement a heap (as a priority queue where priority is defined as the Manhattan distance from the goal). Use the heap to find paths through the maze (from Start to Goal) utilizing your maze program. Your program should visually distinguish between the path identified and any backtracking that may have occurred. In addition, illustrate the content of the heap at each step.

##Project: Maze 6 (Due at the end of Topic 7)
Modify your Maze 3 to represent the maze as a graph and solve by Depth First Search.

##Project: Maze 7 (Due at the end of Topic 7)
Modify your Maze 4 to represent the maze as a graph and solve by Breadth First Search.


##Deliverables
You are expected to follow these standard guidelines for all parts.

##Implementation notes:
1.	Write your code in the language specified by your instructor.
2.	The input to your program should be screen based or from a file, as directed by your instructor.
3.	The output of your program should appear on screen and/or in a file, as directed by your instructor.
4.	There are always multiple ways to code a project. In class, we will discuss several options. It is up to you to choose the implementation you prefer. Your code must perform all the required tasks and all other requirements in this document must be met.
5.	Your code must be fully commented, but focus on the main programming blocks.
6.	Include a screenshot of the running program.
7.	When an error in reading data is detected, your program should alert the user in a helpful manner (think of it as customer service to the user).

##Submit the following:
1.	By Day 5 of the week assigned: a summary of the main purpose of your project, a detailed description of your implementation approach, and a code skeleton (i.e., class with stubs for all methods)
2.	By the assignment due date: complete running program, commented code, the input file, and the entire code project as one zipped file. Include a ReadMe file with instruction on how to run it and what software is required.
